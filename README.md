EX NO: 3

DATE:2-09-2023

Objective:

To diagnose and resolve common issues in an operating system.

Materials:

Computer with the problematic OS
Access to user documentation or online resources

Procedure:

1. Identify the Problem:
Determine the exact nature of the problem. Common issues
include system crashes, slow performance, software errors, and
hardware malfunctions. Note any error messages or unusual
behavior.

2. Backup Data:
Before proceeding with troubleshooting, ensure you have a
backup of critical data to prevent data loss during the process.

3. Check for Recent Changes:
Consider any recent changes or installations that might have
triggered the problem (e.g., new software, hardware, updates).

4. Restart the Computer:
Sometimes, a simple restart can resolve minor issues. Try
rebooting your computer.

5. Search for Error Messages:
If there are error messages, search online for their meanings and
possible solutions. Many error messages have known fixes.

6. Update Software:
Ensure your OS, drivers, and software are up-to-date. Outdated
software can lead to compatibility issues.
7. Run System Diagnostics:
Many OSs include built-in diagnostic tools. Use these tools to
identify hardware or software problems. On Windows, you can
use the built-in "Windows Memory Diagnostic," and on Linux, you
can use various command-line tools like "memtest86" for memory
testing.

8. Check for Malware:
Scan your system for malware using reputable antivirus or
anti-malware software. Ensure your antivirus definitions are
up-to-date.

9. Disable Startup Programs:
Some performance issues may be due to too many programs
starting at boot. Disable unnecessary startup programs.

10. Safe Mode Boot:
Boot your OS into safe mode to see if the problem persists. Safe
mode loads a minimal set of drivers and may help identify if
third-party software is causing issues.

11. Check Hardware Connections:
If you suspect hardware issues, check connections for peripherals
like RAM, hard drives, and cables. Re-seat components if
necessary.

12. Restore from Backup:
If you have a recent system backup and the issue is severe,
consider restoring your OS to a previous state.

13. Check Event Logs:
Review system logs or event viewer to identify any critical errors
or events that occurred before the problem started.

14. Reinstall Drivers:
If you suspect driver issues, uninstall and reinstall drivers for
hardware components.

15. Repair or Reinstall OS:
As a last resort, consider repairing or reinstalling the OS. Be sure
to back up data first.

16. Seek Professional Help:
If you are unable to resolve the issue or suspect hardware
problems, contact a professional technician or the OS
manufacturer's support.

17. Preventive Measures:
After resolving the issue, take preventive measures to avoid
similar problems in the future, such as keeping software updated
and maintaining regular backups.

18. Document the Solution:
Record the steps you took to troubleshoot and resolve the issue
for future reference.

Result :

Successfully we done the Troubleshooting OS.
